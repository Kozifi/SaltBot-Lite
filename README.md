# SaltBot for Discord.js

This is a collection of commands and action for my discord.js bot [SaltBot](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/bots/539453930313351168). This collection assumes that you have some type of command handler.

 All scripts are originally written in JavaScript but now converted to TypeScript. If you are not comfortable working with TypeScript or don't have it set up, you can use the compiled JavaScript files instead. 

#### Why is SaltBot closed source?

SaltBot contains a lot of personalized stuff written for my school, such as automatically updated lunch and schedule commands, namelists etc. Therefore the entire source code will not be public.



# Commands

### -avatar [user] 

###### TypeScript: [avatar.ts](Code/TypeScript/avatar.ts), JavaScript: [avatar.js](Code/JavaScript/avatar.js)

Sends your own or a mentioned users avatar.
